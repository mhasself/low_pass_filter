What this is
------------

This code implements a low-pass filter similar to the MCE's
(e-mode.phas.ubc.ca/mcewiki) 4-poll readout filter.  This should be a
very good imitation aside from the use of 8-bit based datatypes
(int32_t and int64_t) instead of the tailored accumulators in MCE
firmware.

The goal was to time such operations on a x86 CPU... on my old dual
core (4 thread) AMD, this can (just barely) keep up with 12000
channels at 30 kHz.


Running the test
----------------

To generate the transfer function plots:

  make test

To run the timing test (which passes data through numpy C interface):

  make test_np
  python test_np_filt.py
